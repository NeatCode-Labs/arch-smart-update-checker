4. Requires appropriate permissions for security events

### Security Logging Infrastructure

Security events are now logged with:
- Event type classification
- Contextual details (sanitized)
- Severity levels (info, warning, error, critical)
- Automatic sanitization to prevent log injection

### Sandboxing Architecture

The sandboxing implementation:
- Supports multiple sandbox backends
- Gracefully falls back if sandbox tools unavailable
- Configures appropriate restrictions based on command type
- Maintains functionality while enhancing security
