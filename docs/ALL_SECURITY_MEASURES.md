# ALL_SECURITY_MEASURES.md

> **Note:** The following are the security measures currently active in Arch Smart Update Checker v2.2.0 (as of July 26, 2025).

## 1. Input Validation & Sanitization

- **Centralized SecurityFilter (src/utils/validators.py):**
  - Strict maximum lengths for all input types (package names, URLs, filenames, paths, commands, config values, log messages).
  - Dangerous character sets and common injection patterns are blocked for shell, path, and filename contexts.
  - Unicode normalization and rejection of dangerous Unicode categories (control, format, private use).
  - Validation for package names, numeric input, URLs (with HTTPS enforcement and domain whitelisting), file paths (with extension and existence checks), and configuration values.
  - HTML and command argument sanitization, JSON structure validation, and environment variable checks.
  - Secure error handling to prevent information disclosure.

- **GUI Input Validation (src/gui/input_validator.py):**
  - Regex-based validation for all user-facing fields (package names, config keys, file paths, URLs, numeric/alphanumeric, safe text).
  - Blocks HTML/XML/control chars, shell injection chars, script protocols, dangerous Python/JS functions, SQL injection, path traversal, and suspicious dialog triggers.
  - Unicode normalization and length checks for all GUI input.
  - Sanitization and error feedback for invalid or dangerous input.

## 2. Secure Subprocess Execution

- **SecureSubprocess Wrapper (src/utils/subprocess_wrapper.py):**
  - All subprocesses are run with `shell=False` to prevent shell injection.
  - Command whitelisting and validation: only essential/optional commands are allowed, with privilege escalation (sudo) tightly controlled.
  - File permission and ownership checks for all executed commands.
  - Directory and executable type safety checks.
  - Sandboxing support (see below).
  - Secure file and URL opening with sandboxing and timeouts.
  - Security event logging for all privileged, sandboxed, or unauthorized command attempts.
  - Sanitized debug logging for all subprocess invocations.

## 3. Sandboxing & Mandatory Access Control

- **Bubblewrap/AppArmor/SELinux Integration (src/utils/sandbox_profiles.py):**
  - Multiple sandbox profiles for file access, package manager, terminal, and network operations.
  - Profiles define strict bind mounts, tmpfs, and device access, with levels: BASIC, STANDARD, STRICT, PARANOID.
  - File access profiles restrict to whitelisted paths only.
  - Package manager profiles allow only necessary directories for queries/updates.
  - Terminal/network profiles restrict or allow network as needed.
  - Sandboxing is applied automatically for sensitive operations, with fallback to legacy methods if unavailable.
  - Security event logging for all sandboxed operations.

## 4. Security Event Logging & Audit

- **Comprehensive Logging (src/utils/logger.py):**
  - Thread-safe, color-coded logging with global configuration.
  - Dedicated security log file (system or user directory fallback).
  - Rate limiting for security events to prevent log flooding.
  - Security events logged for: unauthorized commands, privilege escalation, sandboxed operations, validation failures, multiple instance attempts, and more.
  - Sanitization of all log messages to prevent log injection or sensitive data leaks.
  - Secure debug logger for sensitive operations.

## 5. Authentication & Privilege Management

- **Privilege Escalation:**
  - Uses `pkexec` (polkit) by default, with fallback to `sudo` or `doas` as needed.
  - Password prompts handled securely (polkit for GUI via pkexec, terminal input for CLI).
  - Only whitelisted commands allowed with privilege escalation.
  - All privileged operations are logged as security events.

## 6. File System & Configuration Security

- **File Access:**
  - All file operations use secure wrappers with path validation, extension checks, and existence requirements.
  - Configuration files stored in user-specific directories with safe permissions.
  - No world-writable locations or unsafe temp files.
  - Log files are user-owned and stored in predictable, safe locations.

## 7. Network Security

- **Feed Fetching & Update Checking:**
  - Enforces HTTPS for all external feeds and package repository access.
  - Validates domains and strips HTML from feed content.
  - Enforces request timeouts and certificate verification.
  - No custom repository additions allowed.

## 8. Memory Protection

- **Secure Memory Management:**
  - Sensitive data is zeroed and memory is locked when possible.
  - Automatic cleanup of sensitive objects.
  - Thread-safe operations and resource cleanup on thread termination.

## 9. Audit Trail & Update History

- **Update History:**
  - All update operations are logged with timestamp, package/version info, status, exit code, and duration.
  - History is stored securely and shown in the GUI for user review.

## 10. AppArmor & SELinux Profiles

- **Mandatory Access Control:**
  - Comprehensive AppArmor and SELinux profiles included for advanced users.
  - Profiles restrict file, network, and process access for the app and its subprocesses.
  - Installation scripts and documentation provided for easy setup.

## 11. Additional Protections

- **Single Instance Lock:** Prevents concurrent execution of the app.
- **Audit Logging:** All security-relevant events are logged for later review.
- **SBOM Generation:** Software Bill of Materials is generated in CI for supply chain transparency.
- **CI Security Scanning:** Automated CodeQL and Bandit scans on every push/PR.

This report covers all major security measures implemented in the Arch Smart Update Checker, based on a thorough code and documentation review. The app demonstrates a strong, multi-layered security posture, with careful attention to input validation, subprocess safety, sandboxing, audit logging, and system hardening.
