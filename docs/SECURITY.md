## Reporting a Vulnerability

The Arch Smart Update Checker team takes security vulnerabilities seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings.

### How to Report

Please report security vulnerabilities by emailing:

**Email:** neatcodelabs@gmail.com  
**Subject:** [SECURITY] Arch Smart Update Checker - [Brief Description]

### What to Include

When reporting a vulnerability, please include:

1. **Description**: A clear description of the vulnerability
2. **Steps to Reproduce**: Detailed steps to reproduce the issue
3. **Impact**: The potential impact of the vulnerability
4. **Affected Versions**: Which versions are affected
5. **Suggested Fix**: If you have a suggestion for fixing the issue

### Response Time

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status Update**: Within 7 days
- **Resolution Target**: Within 30 days for critical issues

### Disclosure Policy

- We request that you **do not publicly disclose** the vulnerability until we have had a chance to address it
- We will coordinate with you on the disclosure timeline
- We will credit you for the discovery (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)

### Out of Scope

The following are **not** considered security vulnerabilities:

- Issues requiring physical access to the user's system
- Social engineering attacks
- Denial of service attacks that require significant resources
- Issues in third-party dependencies (report these to the respective projects)

## Security Measures

Arch Smart Update Checker implements multiple security measures:

### Input Validation
- All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- Package names are validated against strict patterns
- Command injection prevention through parameterized commands

### Secure Subprocess Execution
- No shell execution (`shell=False`)
- Command whitelisting
- Sandboxing support (Bubblewrap/Firejail)
- Privilege separation

### File System Security
- Secure temporary file creation
- Path traversal prevention
- Proper file permissions (0600 for sensitive files)

### Memory Protection
- Sensitive data clearing
- No credential storage
- Secure memory management

### Access Control
- AppArmor profile available
- SELinux policy available
- Single instance enforcement

### Logging and Auditing
- Security event logging
- Sanitized log output
- No sensitive data in logs

## Security Best Practices for Users

1. **Keep the application updated**: Always use the latest version
2. **Use security profiles**: Enable AppArmor or SELinux profiles if available
3. **Review permissions**: Only grant necessary permissions
4. **Verify sources**: Only install from trusted sources
5. **Regular audits**: Review security logs periodically
