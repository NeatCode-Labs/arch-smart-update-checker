# Incident Response Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the procedures for responding to security incidents affecting the Arch Smart Update Checker project. All maintainers should be familiar with these procedures.

## Incident Response Team

### Roles and Responsibilities

- **Incident Commander**: Overall coordination and decision-making
- **Technical Lead**: Technical investigation and remediation
- **Communications Lead**: User and stakeholder communication
- **Documentation Lead**: Incident documentation and post-mortem

## Incident Classification

### Severity Levels

- **P0 (Critical)**: Active exploitation, data breach, or system compromise
- **P1 (High)**: Exploitable vulnerability in production, potential for significant impact
- **P2 (Medium)**: Security vulnerability with limited impact or requiring user interaction
- **P3 (Low)**: Minor security issues, defense-in-depth improvements

## Response Procedures

### 1. Detection and Triage (0-2 hours)

**Actions:**
1. Confirm the incident is legitimate
2. Assess initial severity
3. Notify incident response team
4. Create incident tracking issue (private)
5. Begin incident log

**Key Questions:**
- What is the nature of the vulnerability?
- Is it being actively exploited?
- What versions are affected?
- What is the potential impact?

### 2. Containment (2-6 hours)

**Immediate Actions:**
1. Disable affected features if necessary
2. Implement temporary mitigations
3. Monitor for active exploitation
4. Prepare hotfix if needed

**Documentation:**
- Record all containment actions
- Note any user impact
- Track timeline of events

### 3. Investigation (6-24 hours)

**Technical Analysis:**
1. Root cause analysis
2. Determine full scope of impact
3. Identify all affected components
4. Review logs for exploitation attempts

**Security Assessment:**
- Evaluate attack vectors
- Assess data exposure
- Review related code for similar issues
- Check for persistence mechanisms

### 4. Remediation (24-72 hours)

**Fix Development:**
1. Develop comprehensive fix
2. Security review of proposed changes
3. Test fixes thoroughly
4. Prepare release notes

**Verification:**
- Confirm vulnerability is resolved
- Test for regressions
- Security scan the fix
- Peer review required

### 5. Recovery (72+ hours)

**Release Process:**
1. Create security release
2. Update all supported versions
3. Deploy fixes
4. Monitor for issues

**User Actions:**
- Publish security advisory
- Update documentation
- Notify package maintainers
- Coordinate disclosure

### 6. Post-Incident (1 week)

**Review and Improve:**
1. Conduct post-mortem meeting
2. Document lessons learned
3. Update response procedures
4. Implement preventive measures

**Follow-up:**
- Thank reporters
- Update security measures
- Review similar code patterns
- Plan security improvements
